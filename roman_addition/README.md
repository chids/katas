#### What

This is the second part of the roman numerals kata as [described here](http://turner.faculty.swau.edu/mathematics/materialslibrary/roman/), i.e. addition of roman numerals without the use of integers.

#### Context

We had [Woody Zuill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/woodyzuill/) run a mob programming lecture and workshop at work. This kata was used during the workshop where we coded in Javascript. After the workshop I did my best to emulate the flow of my group, alone, and in Erlang. I.e. I gave myself the problems in the same order as Woody gave them to us in the workshop in an attempt to recreate the step by step iterative process. Having just done the kata I was obviously biased but it was a fun and easy way for me to spend a little time tinkering with Erlang. The workflow can be followed through the commits in the [pull request](https://github.com/chids/katas/pull/1).
